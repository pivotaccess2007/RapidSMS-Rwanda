To develop RapidSMS, you'll need to symlink
a few subdirectories into your Python path,
because we're currently developing more than
one library in a single repository.

In Bash, we do this:

  cd rapidsms/lib
  sudo ln -s * /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

Now all of the subdirectories (which are
Python modules) of lib are available globally.
This obviously means that you can only run a
single version of RapidSMS on each computer.

If you don't want to mess with your system
directories, you can also simply run the
following from a Bash shell:

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/rapidsms/lib

Change the path, of course, to match wherever you
cloned the RapidSMS repository to. Note that you
will have to run this every time you start work on
RapidSMS. However, it offers the advantage of 
allowing you to have more than one clone of
RapidSMS on your system.

We're going to find a better way to do this,
just not right now. Relative imports sounds
good.
