# -- APPS
#
# In this area you can define configurations for individual applications. The app
# must be listed under the section [rapidsms] in "apps". If no configuration is
# listed for your app it will use the default parameters. However, if you wish to
# run two apps of the same type, you MUST define configure them explicitly here.

# -- BACKENDS
#
# In this area you can define configurations for individual backends. The backend
# must be listed under the section [rapidsms] in "backends". If no configuration is
# listed for your backend it will use the default parameters. However, if you wish to
# run two backends of the same type, you MUST define configure them explicitly here.

# -- DJANGO
#
# In this area you can define configuration options for django that would usually
# go into your settings.py file. There's no need to make the variables uppercase
# also do not specify strings by surrounding them with the quotes " or '. This
# is automatically taken care of before injecting it into django's core configuration
